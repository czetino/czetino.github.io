Reset my admin password
Use these steps if you forgot your password but you're able to sign in to Microsoft 365 because, for example, your password is saved in your browser:

Select your name (icon) in upper right corner > View Account.

In your contact card, double-check that your Alternate email is accurate and that you've provided a mobile phone number. If not, change them now. Some details might be provided by your IT or human resources department. If you want to update those details, contact them or your admin.

Sign out: select your name in the upper right corner > Sign out.

Now sign in again: type your user name > Next > and then select Forgot password.

Follow the steps in the wizard to reset your password. It uses your alternate contact info to verify you're the right person to reset your password.

If you forgot your password and can't sign in:

Ask global admin in your business to reset your password for you.

Make sure you've provided alternate contact information, including a mobile phone number.

Or, call Microsoft Support.
